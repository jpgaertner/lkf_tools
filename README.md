# lkf_tools
Tools to detect and track deformation features (leads and pressure ridges) in sea-ice deformation data.

## Getting Started
Download/clone this repository.

### Installing python
First you need to install conda to install the python environment needed for this package. This can easily be done using a [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

After installing conda with a miniforge you can install the python environment using:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
and activate the environment:
```
conda activate lkf_tools
```
To install as python package run the following command with the repository directory:
```
$ python setup.py develop
```

## Generate LKF data-set

There is a [tutorial notebook](notebooks/tutorial_gen_dataset.ipynb) that illustrates how to generate a LKF data-set from a netcdf file. This tutorial uses model output from the [SIREx model output repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5555329) and also uses the SIREx sampling strategies that are described in detail in this [Hutter et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JC017667). The tutorial shows you how to:
* download and read in the netcdf file
* detect LKFs in the netcdf file
* run the tracking algorithm on the detected LKFs
* some basic plotting routines of the extracted LKFs
